The MATLAB source codes and datasets can be used only for academic purposes.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* The implementations of our method and the baselines.\r\n* A dataset including the adjacency matrix and information of about 60000 checkins of 1000 users in Brazil.\r\n* A collection of standard evaluation measures for the temporal and spatial predictions\r\n* m-files for plotting the performance measures.\r\n\r\n## Execution and Results\r\nThe project is executed successfully on Matlab R2015a. You also may need to install the Optimization toolbox beforehand.\r\nTo reproduce the results on synthetic data, run the *exec_synth.m*. For the real data, use the *exec_real.m*.\r\nYou can configure model parameters through those files as well. *dataset_final.mat* is the main data of the project and it consists of more than 60000 events of 1000 the Brazilian users and the corresponding adjacency matrix.\r\nResults will be saved in `Result` folder.\r\nFor the edge recovery evaluation of algorithm using the AUC measure on synth data, you need to run *exec_synth_recovery_test.m*. The results will be saved in `Results_unknown_adjacency` folder.\r\nPlease note that this script works only if you perform the *exec_synth.m* with the option of `unknown_adjacency` beforehand. \r\nThe results are plotted with the code within the `plot` folder. Each m-file is associated with a single experiment result.\r\n",
